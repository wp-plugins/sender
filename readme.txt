= How can i make sure that the subscriber has read my letter? =

This function will be added in the stable version of plugin.

For sending letters in plugin used wp_cron - Wordpress function for periodic execution of any planned actions. This function depends on the traffic of your site: the more visitors, the faster the letters will be sent.
